I want to create a visually striking, animation-rich, and interactive portfolio website that showcases my expertise as a 3D Visualizer and VFX Artist. The website should reflect creativity, technical mastery, and storytelling through visuals while ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. It should appeal to potential clients, collaborators, and employers by highlighting my artistic vision and technical skills in a futuristic, cinematic style.

Core Features:

1. Home / Hero Section:

A cinematic introduction with my name, title (“3D Visualizer & VFX Artist”), and a short creative statement.

Dynamic animations such as particle effects, 3D shapes, interactive hover elements, or subtle motion backgrounds that evoke depth and movement.

Optionally, embed a short video reel or animation loop in the background to immediately showcase my style.

2. Portfolio Gallery:

Sections categorized by type of work: Architectural renders, VFX breakdowns, animations, motion graphics, etc.

Use sliders, grid layouts, or carousels with hover-triggered animations.

Include video embeds from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, or direct upload previews for animations and walkthroughs.

Provide before/after comparisons or interactive overlays that show different layers or stages of a project.

3. Skills & Tools Showcase:

Animated progress bars, circular graphs, or interactive sliders for tools like Blender, Unreal Engine, Houdini, After Effects, Nuke, etc.

Add tooltips with descriptions or links to certifications and tutorials.

On-scroll animations that trigger as the user reaches this section.

4. About Section:

A creative storytelling layout describing my background, inspirations, and approach.

Include sketches, thumbnails, or mood boards that complement the text.

Subtle animations like fade-ins or parallax effects to enhance the narrative.

5. Contact Section:

A sleek, easy-to-use contact form with fields for name, email, message, and social links (LinkedIn, ArtStation, Instagram, etc.).

Interactive feedback such as animations when a message is sent or error alerts when fields are empty.

6. Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle:

A smooth transition between modes to ensure optimal viewing of visuals and content.

7. Navigation & User Experience:

A sticky header or side menu with icons for easy navigation between sections.

Smooth scrolling, section highlights, and animated scroll indicators.

Lazy loading for images and videos to enhance performance without slowing down animations.

8. Performance Optimization:

Ensure the site loads quickly even with high-quality media assets.

Optimize animations and assets using best practices without compromising visuals.

Ensure SEO-friendly structure and accessibility across devices.

3D & VFX Software: Blender, Unreal Engine, Houdini, After Effects, Nuke, Cinema 4D.

Techniques: Motion graphics, particle systems, lighting effects, animation rigs, compositing, color grading.

Optionally link to certifications, tutorials, or project breakdowns that reflect skill depth.

✅ Tone and Experience:

The website should feel like stepping into a creative world — immersive, artistic, and forward-thinking.

It should communicate passion, technical expertise, and storytelling in an approachable yet professional way.

Interactive elements should invite exploration, encouraging visitors to spend time viewing and appreciating the portfolio.
